=================

Example code for Pinoccio! (pinocc.io)
THIS IS NOT THE OFFICIAL ONE. I've [forked this into the Pinoccio organization](https://github.com/Pinoccio/pinoccio-examples), and am now *only* updating that branch!

**Custom Bootstraps –** Upload a custom Bootstrap sketch to your Scout (via the Arduino IDE) to get it working with servos, [NeoPixels](http://www.adafruit.com/category/168), the [Capacitive Touch Backpack](http://support.pinocc.io/hc/en-us/articles/202311914-Capacitive-Touch), or a [NeuroSky MindFlex](http://www.hackster.io/glowascii/mesh-your-brain). Each comes with a description, a link to the required library, a bootstrap sketch, and an example ScoutScript project or two.

**Example Web pages –** Want to interact with your Pinoccios without going through HQ? You can display real-time temperature or light sensor data on a Web page, or trigger actions remotely. Check out these simple examples of what's possible.

**Mini ScoutScript projects –** Mini-projects to help you learn about different ScoutScript functions, that you can adapt for your own projects.
